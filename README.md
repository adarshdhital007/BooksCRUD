# Books CRUD with PostgreSQL and Angular,Express

This is a basic example of a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for managing books. The application consists of both frontend and backend components, allowing users to interact with and manage a list of books.

## Features

- **Create**: Add new books with information such as title, author, and genre.
- **Read**: View a list of books, and search for specific books.
- **Update**: Edit and update book details, including the title, author, and genre.
- **Delete**: Remove individual books or clear the entire list.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

- **Angular**: A modern JavaScript framework for building dynamic web applications.
- **Angular CLI**: The Command Line Interface for Angular development.
- **HttpClient**: Used for making HTTP requests to the backend API.
- **RxJS**: A library for handling asynchronous operations in Angular.

### Backend

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for building APIs using Node.js.
- **Sequelize**: An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool for interacting with a PostgreSQL database.
- **PostgreSQL**: A robust open-source relational database.
- **CORS**: Middleware for managing Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- **REST API**: Follows RESTful principles for communication between the frontend and backend.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies for the frontend and backend.
3. Configure the PostgreSQL database.
4. Migrate the database schema.
5. Start the backend server.
